or 2224 for https)

Enjoy!

VERSION 3.0.2-beta 
============
+ RNDC queue. Due to DirectAdmin behavior, when it sends multiple "add" requests for newly added domain, 
  every single request forces DirectSlave to trigger `rndc`, which causes CPU load due to `named` config reload.
  Now, if domain added/removed/reloaded on primary, internal rndc queue populated with events and processed 
  once per 30 seconds, `rndc reload` called only if events exists in queue.
  You can watch `rndc` events entries in action.log like this: 
  2017/06/27 13:09:21 RNDC queue triggered with 2 events
  2017/06/27 13:09:21 RNDC output: reloaded

! there is no config reload on -HUP signal handler, -HUP is handled just for compatibility with 'newsyslog'

  (unpatched) version of CGI perl module from some linux distros

  various systems (now for *BSD only, sorry)
- etc/directslave.conf unchanged
